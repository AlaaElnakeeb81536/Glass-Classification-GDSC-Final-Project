# Glass-Classification-GDSC-Final-Project
In order to classify and identify glass, we used logistic regression and various machine learning algorithms to classify glass of known composition and class, and used various metrics to evaluate the classification results comprehensively. To further improve the reliability and accuracy of the classification.

Summary Out of all models i used: Randorm forest is giving best result with:

training accuracy: 0.9793103448275862 test accuracy: 0.7755102040816326 But since it is overfitting we will choose next best model that is: SVM (Non Linear Kernal)

training accuracy: 0.7586206896551724 testing accuracy: 0.7551020408163265
